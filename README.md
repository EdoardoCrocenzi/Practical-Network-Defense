# Practical-Network-Defense
This repository is made for those who are following the Practical Network Defense course in Sapienza that are using an M1 (or higher) chip (in general for everyone who has an ARM device). I will try to fix any problems, if there are any, while I'm following the course. I hope that for the end of it, this repository can be used by other students in the next years as the official repository for everyone that has an ARM architecture.

To use this respository, you must create your own virtual machine (I'm currently using UTM on Mac to create them). After that, just install Kathara, by following the instructions on its official website (or the github repository), and Docker. After that, you are now able to use this repo
